Changes made:
  The extension has been updated to use the Komodo application UUID's
  and also an overlay for the Komodo UI has been added. A Python shell
  tool has also been added to the extension.

How to use it:
  Install the extension, then go to the "Tools->Extension Developer" menu.
  The most useful feature I find is the "JavaScript Shell", where you can
  type JavaScript snippets of code and also interactive with the xul
  windows and the Komodo JavaScript API. Hint: Try clicking on the
  "enumerateWindows()" link when you first open the shell.

  The beauty of this Shell is that it also provides "Tab completions"
  for objects, including XPCOM objects, nice!

title: Console pane
---
The console pane is accessible from the [bottom panel](workspace.html#Output_Pane), it allows you to interact with the Komodo JavaScript runtime and XPCOM. This is mostly useful when working on Komodo Add-ons, Userscripts or other types of Packages. It is essentially the same as the console in your browsers developer tools, except that it covers the whole application, not just a single website.

To find out what you can do with the Console Pane check out our [SDK](/sdk/index.html) documentation.

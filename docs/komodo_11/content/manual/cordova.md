(Komodo IDE only)

## Cordova Configuration
Komodo will attempt to find Cordova on your system path.  If it can't locate the executable you can manually configure it:

1. Select  **Edit** > **Preferences**.  
1. Select the **Environment** page from the list on the left.
1. Enter, or select the path, in the **Cordova Location** text box.

## Commando
To execute commands in Commando, press `Ctrl+Shift+o` to open Commando (`Cmd+Shift+o` on macOS) and select the Shell scope > Cordova.  Here you will see the various commands with completions added.  Remember you can run ANY command you want, regardless of whether or not Komodo provides completions for it.

## Dynamic Toolbar
If you create a Komodo project in your Cordova project root, Komodo will detect a that it's in a Cordova project and provide a Cordova button in the Dynamic toolbar.

This button allows you to *run* or *build* your application as well as directly access the Cordova Shell scope in Commando to perform additional actions.

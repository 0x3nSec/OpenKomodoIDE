title: Documentation browser
---
(Komodo IDE only)

Komodo includes a built in documentation browser (devdocs.io) that allows you to easily access information about the languages and tools supported by Komodo. It's a way of quickly referencing documentation on classes, functions, and properties without leaving the editor.

## Invocation

The documentation browser is a sub-components of [[Commando]], and can be accessed as one of its "Scopes". The Documentation browser can also be accessed directly from the toolbar by pressing it's Icon. Pressing this icon brings up the documentation for the current language. If you have a word under your cursor in the editor then this word will be pre-filled as the search query.

There are also several keybindings available to invoke the Documentation browser in different ways, for example you could invoke the Documentation browser for a specific language. Search for "Documentation" under [Key Binding Preferences](prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings) to find available keybindings.

## Usage

The searching aspect of the Documentation browser is fairly self-explanatory; simply search for the class, function, property, etc. you are interested in and navigate to the relevant result. When navigating Komodo will "preview" the selected item. When selecting a result (by pressing enter) Komodo will focus on the result by hiding the search pane. It will also show shortcuts for all the links and buttons in the documentation. Hitting a shortcut on your keyboard will effectively activate that link, allowing you to navigate the documentation without the need of your mouse.

### Online Documentation

The online documentation button will, as implied, open the online documentation for the selected item. IF the documentation entry can be properly interpreted. It is possible that Komodo can not interpret the online documentation entry for your selection for various reasons (online documentation sites can and will change), if this happens Komodo will instead open a google search with the relevant keywords.

### Insert Snippet

Hitting the insert snippet button will insert the code for the current entry into the editor where your caret is currently located.

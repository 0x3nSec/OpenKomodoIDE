(Komodo IDE only)

## Grunt Configuration
Komodo will attempt to find Grunt on your system path.  If it can't locate the executable you can manually configure it under **Edit**(**Komodo** on macOS) > **Preferences** > **Languages** : **Node.js**: Grunt Location.

## Commando
To execute commands in Commando, open Commando (`Ctrl` or `Cmd` (OSX) + `Shift` + `o`) and select the Shell scope > Grunt.  Here you will see the various  commands with completions added.  Remember you can run ANY command you want, regardless of whether or not we've provided completions for it.

## Dynamic Toolbar
If you create a Komodo project in your Grunt project root, Komodo will detect a that it's in a Grunt project and provide a Grunt button in the Dynamic toolbar.

This button allows you to install new tasks through Commando Grunt scope as well as run any existing installed tasks.

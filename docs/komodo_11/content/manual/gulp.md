(Komodo IDE only)

## Gulp Configuration
Komodo will attempt to find Gulp on your system path.  If it can't locate the executable you can manually configure it under **Edit**(**Komodo** on macOS) > **Preferences** > **Languages** > **Node.js**: Gulp Location.

## Commando
To execute commands in Commando, open Commando (`Ctrl` or `Cmd` (macOS) + `Shift` + `o`) and select the Shell scope > Gulp.  Here you will see the various commands with completions added.  Remember you can run ANY command you want, regardless of whether or not we've provided completions for it.

## Dynamic Toolbar
If you create a Komodo project in your Gulp project root, Komodo will detect a that it's in a Gulp project and provide a Gulp button in the Dynamic toolbar.

This button allows you to install new tasks through Commando Gulp scope as well as run any existing installed tasks.

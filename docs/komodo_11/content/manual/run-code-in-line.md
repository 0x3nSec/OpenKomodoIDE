title: Run Code In-Line
---
Komodo lets you run the code in the current buffer "in-line" without interrupting your workflow. This allows you to run the code that is currently in your buffer, without having to save it. You can also use it to run the code under your selection, in case you only want to run a portion of the file.

To run your code in-line, simply hit the lighting icon in your toolbar. If you are using a language that is supported Komodo will invoke the current buffer using the interpreter configured for that language.

Alternatively you can configure a shortcut to run your code in-line instead, to do this head over to your [Key Binding Preferences](prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings) and set a binding for "Run File/Selection In-line".

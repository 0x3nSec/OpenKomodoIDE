There are a number of ways to get help if you run into problems using Komodo.

## Documentation

Have a look through this user guide to see if there is any relevant documentation. Use the Search field in the top right corner of the Komodo Help window to search the table of contents.

<a name="support_forums" id="support_forums"></a>
## Komodo Forums

Komodo developers monitor the [Komodo forums](http://forum.komodoide.com/) for issues. You can search the site to see if other users have encountered a similar problem.

RSS feeds are available for all forums and articles.

## Komodo IRC Channel

Komodo developers are usually in the Komodo IRC channel (mostly 9am-5pm PST time), on the `irc://irc.mozilla.org#komodo` channel.

You can also use a web irc client, like [Kiwi IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.mozilla.org/komodo?nick=komodo_user).

## Reporting Bugs

If you have found a bug, we'd like to know about it. First, query our on-line bug database to see if your bug has already been reported:

[Bug list](https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/issues)

Try a few searches using different keywords related to the problem; someone else may have reported the same problem, but described it slightly differently. If you can't find an existing bug, submit a new one:

[File a bug](https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/issues/new)

Your bug will be assigned a bug ID (and related URL) that you can use to monitor the progress of the bug. The system can also email you when your bug is resolved.

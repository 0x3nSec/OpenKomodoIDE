title: Slack Share
---
The Slack Share feature allows users to post files and snippets from Komodo IDE to a channel, group or user in their Slack team.  It increases productivity of users by allowing fast and easy content sharing.  

The only information we use is the *ID* + *name* of each user, group or channel.  We use the ID to send the message.  We use the human readable name to show in a list for the user to select from.

We do not look at any other information returned by the API calls and we do not permanently store the information we use.

## Installation

Use the *Add to Slack* button below to install.

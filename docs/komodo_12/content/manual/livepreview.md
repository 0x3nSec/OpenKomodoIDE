title: Live preview

You can use Live Preview to view a preview of the output of HTML or Markdown files as you work on them. This allows you immediately see the result of changes you make to the tags or markdown in the file, offering a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) view of the file like you have in a word processor.

To view the live preview for a file:

1. Open an HTML or Markdown file in the Editor pane.
1. Click Preview ![Preview icon](/images/live_preview.png) in the side toolbar.
    **Tip**: Alternatively, you can type `cmd_preview` in the Go to Anything (Commando) text box to launch Live Preview.

The live preview of the file is displayed in a separate tab in the **Editor** pane. As you make changes to the source file, the preview refreshes automatically.

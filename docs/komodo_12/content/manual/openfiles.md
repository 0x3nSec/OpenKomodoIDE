Additionally you can close the file by right clicking on the list item, or by pressing the relevant keybinding (Editor: Close Current Buffer).

## File Actions

Upon right clicking a file in the Open Files list you will receive the same context menu as when right clicking a tab, allowing you to perform actions upon the relevant file.

## Key Bindings

Open Files adds the following 2 key bindings:

- User Interface: Focus on Open Files Pane
- User Interface: Show/Hide Open Files Pane

To use these key bindings, define them in the **Preferences** dialog box in the **Editor** : **Key Bindings** page. For more info refer to the [Key Binding documentation](keybind.html).

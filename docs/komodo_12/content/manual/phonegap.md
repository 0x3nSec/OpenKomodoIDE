(Komodo IDE only)

## PhoneGap Configuration
Configure PhoneGap by selecting **Edit**(**Komodo** on macOS) > **Preferences** > **Environment**: PhoneGap Location.  If PhoneGap is already on your system path verify that **Find on Path** is selected, otherwise *browse* to the directory containing the executable and select the executable.

## Commando
To execute commands in Commando, open Commando (`Ctrl` or `Cmd` (macOS) + `Shift` + `o`) and select the Shell scope > PhoneGap.  Here you will see the various commands with completions added.  Remember you can run ANY command you want, regardless of whether or not we've provided completions for it.

## Dynamic Toolbar
If you create a Komodo project in your PhoneGap project root, Komodo will detect a that it's in a PhoneGap project and provide a PhoneGap button in the Dynamic toolbar.

This button allows you to run or build your application as well as directly access the PhoneGap Shell scope in Commando to perform additional actions.

Use [Incremental Search](/manual/search.html#search_incr) to quickly find all occurrences of a string in all open files. (The key bindings mentioned below are part of the default Windows/Linux [key binding](/manual/prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings) set. If you are using Komodo on macOS, substitute `Cmd+I` for `Ctrl+I`.)

1. Select the string to search for and press `Ctrl+I`.                                                                 

1. Press `Ctrl+I` to find the next occurrence of the string. Continue pressing `Ctrl+I` to find all occurrences in the current file.  

1. Press `Ctrl+Page Down` to change to the next open file, and then press `Ctrl+I` to find the next occurrence string.            

You can also use the up and down arrows to move between occurrences of the string.

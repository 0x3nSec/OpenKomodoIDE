- The current cla.txt is closer to a corporate one. Compare to the quite
  different commiter's agreement for Mozilla. Take the dafi example though:
  if not given commit access, this would fall under our using the Mozilla
  clause of identifying the commiter (e.g. "code from Davide Fianco") then
  we'd have a list of contributors (and a list of commiters with agreements)
  in the internal Komodo src/cla directory with contact information.
- Figure the above out, write up drafts and suggestions.
- Vet it.
- Get approval.
- Blog it and update wiki.openkomodo.com. Find a place for this info. On
  www.activestate.com? komodo.org? openkomodo.com?

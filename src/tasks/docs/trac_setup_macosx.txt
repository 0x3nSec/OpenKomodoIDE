# Installing Trac prerequisites on Mac OS X (10.5)

- Python

  Currently I'm using an ActivePython 2.6 installation, but Python 2.5 is
  fine too.
  
- 'setuptools' and 'easy_install' Python packages

        cd tmp
        wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
        sudo python2.5 ez_setup.py

- Append that Python's bin dir to your PATH. I have this Python
  set as my current so have this:
    
        export PATH=$PATH:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin

  It is working if `which easy_install` points to the directory of the
  Python installation you want to use.

- Install trac 0.11.4

        $ which easy_install
        /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/easy_install
        $ sudo easy_install Trac

  For me this installed Genshi 0.5.1 as well.
  
  TODO: Did this install Pygments as well? If not this can be installed
  via `sudo easy_install Pygments`.
  TODO: start here, integrating notes from Makefile.py::_make_mac()

- Database connector: hoping this will work with SQLite3 for which APy 2.6
  already has a connector.

- (Optional.) Python bindings to Subversion. These are optional because
  for tasks testing we are not using the scc parts of a Trac instance.
  Without svn bindings you may (depending on your Trac config) get a
  warning banner on Trac pages.

  I had Subversion 1.6.1 from Collabnet installed. Python bindings in
  "/opt/subversion/lib/svn-python/...".  While it looks like these link
  against Python *2.3* (the system Python version on Mac OS 10.4), they
  seem to at least *import* with Python 2.5 and 2.6.

- `htpasswd` for create HTTP Basic auth entries. On Mac OS X I had this
  already in `/usr/sbin/htpasswd`.



# Some *old* out of date notes

Here-in some *old* notes on setting up Trac on Mac OS X. First just try the
steps above. If have trouble then you can try these notes.
